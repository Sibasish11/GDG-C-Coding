# GDG-C-Coding
This project was built for a coding competition organized by Google Developer Group Bhubaneswar. It solves a zigzag matrix traversal problem in C++, applying prime number logic and pointer-based memory handling. The solution demonstrates efficient algorithm design using dynamic memory allocation and custom prime checking.
